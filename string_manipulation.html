		//1. charAt(x) we manipulate strings to make it easier for us when working with lots of strings so we don't have to call it again and again
		// var longestWord = "antidisestablishmentalism"; //declare a variable and save the string in that variable
		// document.write(longestWord.charAt (1)); //the charAt says select the character at index (x) where x is a number

		
		//2. charCodeAt(x) this returns the number that represents the character on the unicode chart
		// var longestWord = "antidisestablishmentalism"; //declare a variable and save a string into it
		// document.write(longestWord.charCodeAt(1)); //returns the code that is represented

		//3. concat(v1,v2,...) this combines one or more strings and adds it into the old string.

		// var word = "aynanufi"; //declare a variable 
		// var newWord = word.concat(" is a hopeless romantic" ); //declare another variable and add the first variable with this new var
		// document.write(newWord); //call the new variable. this produces the concatenated string.

		//4. fromCharcode(c1,c2)
